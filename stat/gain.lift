are commonly used to assess the predictive ability of a binary response model, such as a logistic or probit model. Gains and lift plots are popular in direct marketing and credit scoring fields. Another plot, the ROC plot, also summarizes predictive ability. The ROC plot can be produced directly by the LOGISTIC procedure.

The gains plot shows, for each group, the percent difference between the overall proportion of events and the observed proportion of observations in the group that are events. The cumulative gains plot shows the percent difference between the overall proportion of events and the observed proportion of events in all groups up to the current group. The lift plot gives, for each group, the ratio of the proportion of observations in the group that are events to the overall proportion of events. The cumulative lift plot gives event rate up to the current group over the overall event rate. The percent captured plot gives, for each group, the percentage of total events in the group. The cumulative percent captured plots gives the percentage of total events up to the current group. The percent response plot gives the percentage of observations in the group that are events. The cumulative percent response plot gives the percentage of observations up to the current group that are events. Note that percent response and cumulative percent response are often considered gains and cumulative gains.
