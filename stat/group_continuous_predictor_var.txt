1: Y is continuous

If X is continuous and not strongly correlated with y, we can do

	1) use additive models/non-linear regression/splines, like proc gam / proc transreg / proc nlmix and so on

	2) categorize the continuous variables using quantiles, optimal bining in EM and so on. We can use quantiles in SAS by using proc univariate to provide the quantiles and then format the data. An example is in fb.ad.rank.v2.sas.


2: if Y is categorical

	we can still use similar way. A common method used in called WOE(weight of evidence) and use information criteria to select significant variable. 
	WOE will be monotonic to the log odds of y.
